# Exercise 14: reduce/accumulate

library(tidyverse)

values <- 1:10

# try using reduce with any binary function, for example `+`, or min
# (note the backticks with the special infix functions +, -, *, /)

YOUR_CODE_HERE

# try the same, but using the accumulate function instead of reduce.
# accumulate keeps all the intermediate results

YOUR_CODE_HERE

# try with both reduce/accumulate setting the initial value with .init
